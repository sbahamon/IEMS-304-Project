# IEMS-304-Project
R repository predicting wine data based off of attributes inherent in the wine.

Table of Contents:


lazy and step models.R - basic linear and step linear regression models


ridge_and_lasso_models.R - ridge and lasso regression models


Binomial GAM Tree RF models.R - binomial model, generalized additive model, tree model, and random forest model


The random forest was the best predictive model. NOTE: This was a group project done 2 years ago (2015) at the time of this commit - I don't remember who wrote what. As such, I'd like to share credit for these files with Evan Gray, Christie Sui, and Sareena Daniel.
